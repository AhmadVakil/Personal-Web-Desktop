## Info about this application

In this web application you can drag and drop opened applications which will demonstrate JS drag and drop without using any JQuery library and this can be challenging.
You can also open the memory game that I have developed, this is also done without using any library.
I did not use library to prove my own skill in JS, which it was more challenging. With using library everythin will become simple and easy to implement.
The other module have access to some simple CSS hex values which will be changed and stored in the browser history. So, if users wants to have a same color everytime, they just need to change it in that module.

## You have three modules in the taskbar.See below image:

## Memory Game

## Memory Game Size Can Be Changed

Memory games are difficult to solve for some users, so I have implemented a function that can give users flexibility experience. They can customize the size of the game from my Style Controller module.
